Strategic Vision

CINAS consolidates a translational research initiative situated at the convergence of Advanced Computer Science and Radiation Sciences.

In a global scenario where digital transformation redefines scientific paradigms, we operate under the premise that the next frontier of nuclear and medical innovation will come from the intelligence extracted from data.
