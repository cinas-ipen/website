::: {.lead .text-center .mb-5}
The CINAS project portfolio is structured into three strategic axes, uniting scientific rigor with technological innovation.
:::

### 1. Technological Innovation in Diagnosis and Therapy {#research-diag-clinica}

::: {.grid .align-items-center .mb-5}

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-7}

[{{< fa hospital >}}]{.text-danger} From Algorithm to Clinic

We investigate how algorithms can "see" what the human eye cannot, increasing diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic safety.

AI and Oncology: Deep Learning models for volumetric (3D) prostate segmentation and explainability models (XAI).

Federated Learning: Training models across multiple hospitals while preserving privacy (GDPR/LGPD).

Precision Radiotherapy: Machine Learning for automatic gamma index evaluation in treatment plans.

Technology Assessment: Comparative studies (e.g., Dual-Energy CT vs. MRI).

### 2. Information Management and Processes   {#gestao-info-processos}

::: {.grid .align-items-center .mb-5}

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-5 .order-md-2}

[{{< fa chart-line >}}]{.text-primary} Structuring and Governance

We recognize that without organized data, there is no artificial intelligence. We act at the base of the knowledge pyramid.

Knowledge Engineering: Ontologies for nuclear domains and data governance (FAIR principles).

Public Health & Big Data: Data mining from DATASUS (e.g., mammography screening tracking).

Intelligent Search: Semantic solutions for Radiology Information Systems (RIS).

Quality Management: Performance indicators and biosafety manuals in Nuclear Medicine and Radiology.

### 3. Modeling and AI in Nuclear Facilities   {#mod-ia-nuclear}

::: {.grid .align-items-center .mb-5}

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-7}

[{{< fa atom >}}]{.text-warning} Physical-Digital Synergy

The "hard core" of our activities at IPEN, focused on the safety and efficiency of nuclear facilities.

Reactor Operation: Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision support systems for reactor operators.

New Front (Nuclear PIML): Application in neutron tomography.

[{{< fa atom >}}]{.text-primary} New Transversal Front: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)

We are initiating advanced studies in PIML for two strategic applications, aiming to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven models by incorporating physical laws.

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}

[{{< fa atom >}}]{.text-warning} Nuclear

Neutron Tomography: Resolution improvement and solving ill-posed inverse problems.
:::
::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}

[{{< fa hospital >}}]{.text-danger} Health

Medical Imaging: Low-dose tomographic reconstruction and artifact reduction.
:::
:::

Opportunity: We are looking for students (Master's/PhD) and partner researchers interested in co-developing these lines from the ground up.
